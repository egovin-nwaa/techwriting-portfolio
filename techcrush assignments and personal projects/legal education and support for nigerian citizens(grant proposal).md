# LEGAL EDUCATION AND SUPPORT FOR NIGERIAN CITIZENS

There is a widespread justice gap in Nigeria’s legal system. The legal system is often costly, inaccessible, slow, and mistrusted, leaving the majority of citizens unaware of their rights and unable to seek legal remedy. People’s rights are often violated without them knowing how to get justice.  
One common issue that citizens experience is extortion and illegal arrest: citizens, especially youth, are victims of harassment, wrongful arrests, and illegal fees (bail is free but often charged).

## GOAL

To significantly increase the knowledge of vulnerable residents in Nigeria, enabling them to assert their human rights and navigate basic civil issues without fear.

## OBJECTIVES

* Publish a community justice handbook (physical & digital) that summarizes key rights and legal procedures in Pidgin & Formal English.  
* Train youth leaders to serve as first responders and rights advocates during arrest and detention incidents.

## EXPECTED IMPACT

* The trained youth leaders form a lasting, low-cost legal support system in their respective neighbourhoods.  
* Citizens will gain confidence to address local injustices through legal and non-violent means.  
* With increased legal awareness, there should be a reduction in wrongful arrests and an improvement in community relations with law enforcement.
