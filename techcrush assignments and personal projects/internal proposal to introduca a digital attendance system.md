# PROPOSAL TO INTRODUCE A DIGITAL ATTENDANCE SYSTEM AT COSSEL CONSTRUCTION COMPANY NIGERIA LTD.

At Cossel Construction Company Nigeria Ltd, staff attendance is currently recorded manually using a notebook. This method is good, but it contains some faults, which include: 

* Failure of some workers to write their names.  
* Difficulties in calculating work hours.   
* Inaccurate records of arrivals/departures.

The purpose of this proposal is to recommend the adoption of a digital attendance system to improve accuracy and save time. This system will help the HR department to keep better records of employees’ attendance.

## PROPOSED SOLUTION
The transition from the manual system to a Google Sheets-based attendance system.

### **Steps Involved:**

1. Create a shared attendance sheet accessible only to HR and team leaders.  
2. Assign each employee a unique ID to mark attendance daily.  
3. Set automatic date and time stamps for entries to ensure transparency.  
4. Train staff on how to use the system.

This solution requires little to no cost and can be set up within a week.

## BENEFITS

* The digital system will reduce the hours spent compiling monthly reports.  
* The digital system will enable management to view attendance data in real time.  
* The digital system will provide easy access to past attendance data.  
* The digital system will improve punctuality among staff.


## POTENTIAL OBSTACLE

* The non-technical staff might face difficulties in learning how the system works.

## ESTIMATED COST

Google Sheets is free; therefore, the main cost will involve training, setup, and data. The HR or IT team can complete this.

## CONCLUSION

The transition to a digital attendance system will modernize Cossel Construction’s operations and increase overall efficiency. The proposed system is cost-effective and easy to implement.
